# CheckWTRatingChanges
This is devised as a means to (hopefully) check the activity of people in a squadron doing squadron battles by monitoring how much their Rating changes periodically.

This is *very* much a work in progress.

### TODO:
- Complete the README.md
- Create a setup guide
- add a requirements.txt
- Give a basic idea of the functioning of the project
- Maybe move the scraped URL and the Google Sheet ID to a .env or config.py file.
